        <h1 class="sectionTag">Daenerys Targaryen resurrected in life?</h1>
        <p class="sectionSubTag">Daenerys Targaryen died in the Game of Thrones finale, but in the show’s fantasy world, death isn’t always permanent — just ask Jon Snow. So is it possible that Dany could come back to life in the aftermath of Game of Thrones, maybe even setting up a sequel? One key line from the finale may tease how it happens
            After Dany dies and Drogon flies away with her body, the Game of Thrones finale ends with a new king (Bran) and a small council that includes Tyrion, Sam, Davos, and Bronn.That’s the end of it, and it’s not much to go on, but even the direction east may be enough to clue us into what happens to Drogon next. It’s possible the dragon is simply flying his dead mother to her ancestral home in Old Valyria. Or maybe back to Meereen where Daario is presumably still waiting to hear from his Queen. (If that’s what happens, it could spark a whole new war between Essos and Westeros.)

            Then again, maybe Drogon has something else in mind. Rather than simply find a place to lay Dany’s body to rest, maybe the dragon is seeking out someone who can bring the Mother of Dragons back to life.
            
            We know it’s possible. By channeling the Lord of Light, Melisandre was able to revive Jon Snow after he died in Season 5, and Thoros brought Beric back to life seven times using the same magic. Of course, Melisandre and Thoros are both dead, but the Lord of Light still has plenty of living supporters. One in particular stands out: Kinvara.Kinvara, a high-ranking Red Priestess, appeared briefly in Season 6, traveling from Volantis to Meereen to pledge her support for Daenerys Targaryen. We haven’t seen Kinvara since, but it’s worth noting that in Season 7, Melisandre left Westeros and traveled to Volantis on a mysterious mission. Melisandre already knew she would die in Westeros, but maybe she needed to prepare Kinvara for the task ahead.

            Of course, Kinvara isn’t the only Red Woman in Volantis. There’s an entire Red Priesthood of Volantis. So if someone is going to bring Dany back to life, it’s probably going to happen there.</p>

            <h1 class="sectionTag">Why Jon kill daenerys?</h1> 
            <p class="sectionsubTag">A lot went into Dany's ultimate downfall into Mad Queen territory, but a couple of events really pushed her over the edge. The most glaring was the murder of her BFF, Missandei, but a more subtle moment might have had an even more damning effect, psychologically. After the Battle of Winterfell, she makes a big show of legitimizing Gendry, only to sit back and watch Jon get praised and to see her gesture largely overlooked. This is the moment that cements for her that Jon will always be a huge threat. He's a threat to her rule without his blood claim and with it? It's enough to drive a woman mad.Jon did try to give Dany one last chance to prove to him that she didn't need to be taken out in a permanent way. 
            Before he gives her a final hug and stabs her to death, Jon asks Dany to pardon Tyrion, who she has sentenced to death for treason. She refuses and justifies her lack of mercy by saying it's necessary to build the perfect world she knows she can build. Jon realizes that Daenerys isn't going to back down and she'll just keep slaughtering innocents to build her "perfect" world.</p>

            <h1 class="sectionTag">GoT Showrunners Reveal What Drogon Did With Daenerys' Body</h1>
            <p class="sectionsubTag">
                Even after death, Daenerys Targaryen was a bit of an enigma. 

                The murder of Emilia Clarke's icy-haired aspiring queen Daenerys, daughter of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen who was killed on the Iron Throne during his reign, on HBO's Game of Thrones was one of the most shocking moments on a series overflowing with them. After Daenerys succumbed to the (seemingly genetic) Targaryen madness on the series' penultimate episode — torching the capital city of King's Landing to the ground and murdering innocents and enemies alike — she finally reached the Iron Throne. But after spending years journeying to the coveted Throne room, Daenerys never actually took her place as the ruler of Westeros. Before she could even take a seat, her nephew-slash-lover Jon Snow (Kit Harington) confronted her about her decisions and assassinated her for the good of the realm — a choice that led to his banishment back to the Night's Watch, bringing Jon full circle. Daenerys' grieving dragon, Drogon, then torched the Iron Throne to the ground, gingerly scooped up Dany's body, and flew off to an unknown location away from Westeros. 
                Many fans have wondered what happened to Daenerys after she was killed, where Drogon took her, and if there was even a body left to bury. Now, these Game of Thrones mysteries have been unraveled, thanks to the commentary track on the DVD release of the show's final season (via Entertainment Weekly).  

On the track, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss revealed what Drogon did with Daenerys' body, debunking the disturbing idea that Drogon ate his mother and master. When Clarke noted that dragons usually eat the bodies of their masters, Benioff replied, "Drogon's not going to eat you. He's not a cat. Did you see how gently he was nudging you?"

So, it's as simple as that: Drogon didn't fly away with Daenerys' body, dump it somewhere, and devour the remains of his human "mother." At the end of the Game of Thrones series finale, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) notes that Drogon was last seen flying east toward "Volan–" before he's cut off. This huge clue hinted that Drogon took Dany to Volantis, the place where Daenerys and her brother Viserys (Harry Lloyd) spent time in following the assassination of their father during Robert's Rebellion.
